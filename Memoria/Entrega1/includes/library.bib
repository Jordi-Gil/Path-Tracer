abstract = {Some applications of computer graphics require a vivid illusion of reality. These include the spatial organization of machine parts, conceptual architectural design, simulation of mechanisms, and industrial design. There has been moderate success in the automatic generation of wire frame, cardboard model, polyhedra, and quadric surface line drawings. The capability of the machine to generate vivid sterographic pictures has been demonstrated. There are, however considerable reasons for developing techniques by which line drawings of solids can be shaded, especially the enhancement of the sense of solidity and depth. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the value of shading and shadow casting in spatial description. In the line drawing there is no clue as to the relative position of the flat plane and the sheet metal console. When shadows are rendered, it is clear that the plane is below and to the rear of the console, and the hollow nature of the sheet metal assembly is emphasized. Shading can specify the tone or color of a surface and the amount of light falling upon that surface from one or more light sources. Shadows when sharply defined tend to suggest another viewpoint and improves surface definition. When controlled, shading can also emphasize particular parts of the drawing. If techniques for the automatic determination of chiaroscuro with good resolution should prove to be competitive with line drawings, and this is a possibility, machine generated photographs might replace line drawings as the principal mode of graphical communication in engineering and architecture.},

abstract = {We propose a new massively parallel algorithm for constructing high-quality bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) for ray tracing. The algorithm is based on modifying an existing BVH to improve its quality, and executes in linear time at a rate of almost 40M tri- angles/sec on NVIDIA GTX Titan. We also propose an improved approach for parallel splitting of triangles prior to tree construc- tion. Averaged over 20 test scenes, the resulting trees offer over 90{\%} of the ray tracing performance of the best offline construction method (SBVH), while previous fast GPU algorithms offer only about 50{\%}. Compared to state-of-the-art, our method offers a sig- nificant improvement in the majority of practical workloads that need to construct the BVH for each frame. On the average, it gives the best overall performance when tracing between 7 million and 60 billion rays per frame. This covers most interactive applications, product and architectural design, and even movie rendering.},

abstract = {A number of methods for constructing bounding volume hierarchies and point-based octrees on the GPU are based on the idea of ordering primitives along a space-filling curve. A major shortcoming with these methods is that they construct levels of the tree sequentially, which limits the amount of parallelism that they can achieve. We present a novel approach that improves scalability by constructing the entire tree in parallel. Our main contribution is an in-place algorithm for constructing binary radix trees, which we use as a building block for other types of trees.},

The surface is approximated by small polygons in order to solve easily the hidden-parts problem, but the shading of each polygon is computed so that discontinuities of shade are eliminated across the surface and a smooth appearance is obtained.

abstract = {This paper presents a two pass global illumination method based on the concept of photon maps. It represents a significant improvement of a previously described approach both with respect to speed, accuracy and versatility. In the first pass two photon maps are created by emitting packets of energy (photons) from the light sources and storing these as they hit surfaces within the scene. We use one high resolution caustics photon map to render caustics that are visualized directly and one low resolution photon map that is used during the rendering step. The scene is rendered using a distribution ray tracing algorithm optimized by using the in- formation in the photon maps. Shadow photons are used to render shadows more efficiently and the directional information in the photon map is used to generate optimized sampling directions and to limit the recursion in the distribution ray tracer by providing an estimate of the radiance on all surfaces with the exception of specular and highly glossy surfaces. The results presented demonstrate global illumination in scenes containing pro- cedural objects and surfaces with diffuse and glossy reflection models. The imple- mentation is also compared with the Radiance program.},

@inproceedings{Hunt2008,
abstract = {The key to efficient ray tracing is the use of effective acceleration data structures. Traditionally, acceleration structures have been constructed under the assumption that rays approach from any direction with equal probability. However, we observe that for any particular frame the system has significant knowledge about the rays, especially eye rays and hard/soft shadow rays. In this paper we demonstrate that by using this information in conjunction with an appropriate acceleration structure - a set of one or more perspective grids - that ray tracing performance can be significantly improved over prior approaches. This acceleration structure can easily be rebuilt per frame, and provides significantly improved performance for rays originating at or near particular points such as the eye point and the light source(s), without sacrificing the ability to trace arbitrary rays. We demonstrate true real-time frame rates on a game-like scene rendered on an eight-core desktop PC at 1920times1200 resolution for primary visibility, and hard shadows, along with lower frame rates for Monte Carlo soft shadows. In particular, we demonstrate the fastest hard shadow ray-tracing results that we are aware of. We argue that the perspective grid acceleration structure provides insight into why the Z buffer algorithm is faster than traditional ray tracing and shows there is a useful continuum of visibility algorithms between the two traditional approaches.},

@inproceedings{Blinn1977,
abstract = {In the production of computer generated pictures of three dimensional objects, one stage of the calculation is the determination of the intensity of a given object once its visibility has been established. This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

That this should be so is not surprising once it is realized that all rendering methods attempt to model the same physical phenomenon, that of light scattering off various types of surfaces. We mention that the idea behind the rendering equation is hardly new. A description of the phenomenon simulated by this equation has been well studied in the radiative heat transfer literature for years [Siegel and Howell 1981]. However, the form in which we present this equation is well suited for computer graphics, and we believe that this form has not appeared before.},

@inproceedings{Veach1997,
abstract = {We present a new Monte Carlo method for solving the light transport problem, inspired by theMetropolis sampling method in computational physics. To render an image, we generate a sequence of light transport paths by randomly mutating a single current path (e.g. adding a new vertex to the path). Eachmutation is accepted or rejected with a care- fully chosen probability, to ensure that paths are sampled according to the contribution they make to the ideal image. We then estimate this image by sampling many paths, and recording their locations on the image plane. Our algorithm is unbiased, handles general geometric and scattering models, uses little storage, and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than previous unbiased approaches. It performs especially well on problems that are usually con- sidered difficult, e.g. those involving bright indirect light, small geometric holes, or glossy surfaces. Furthermore, it is competitive with previous unbiased algorithms even for relatively simple scenes. The key advantage of the Metropolis approach is that the path space is explored locally, by favoring mutations that make small changes to the current path. This has several consequences. First, the average cost per sample is small (typically only one or two rays). Second, once an impor- tant path is found, the nearby paths are explored as well, thus amortizing the expense of finding such paths over many samples. Third, themutation set is easily extended. By con- structing mutations that preserve certain properties of the path (e.g. which light source is used) while changing others, we can exploit various kinds of coherence in the scene. It is often possible to handle difficult lighting problems efficiently by designing a specialized mutation in this way. CR},

Phenomena such as 'reflection tracking', reflections following a moving observer across a specular surface are produced.

@article{Whitted1980,
abstract = {To accurately render a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene, global illumination information that affects the intensity of each pixel of the image must be known at the time the intensity is calculated. In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of "rays" extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations. Surfaces displayed include curved as well as polygonal surfaces.},
